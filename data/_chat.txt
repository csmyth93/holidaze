[08/07/2024, 12:57:27] Jude: Why are we upside down?
[08/07/2024, 12:57:58] Callum Smyth: because we're going down under
[08/07/2024, 12:59:44] Jude: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[08/07/2024, 13:03:37] Andrew Wenman: hahaha excellent!
[08/07/2024, 13:04:21] Jude: how does everyone feel about 31.12.- 14.1.?

[08/07/2024, 13:53:01] Jude: Ok so I will put in a request for holidays
[08/07/2024, 13:57:42] Jude: Grandma has agreed to look after her grandchild 😂😂😂
[08/07/2024, 14:13:21] Callum Smyth: Cool cool, I’ve got a 1-2-1 tomorrow so will check them dates but I can’t see there being any issue at all
[08/07/2024, 17:47:59] Potato Piehl  🍤: Are we getting back on the 15th with these flights?
[08/07/2024, 17:49:35] Jude: Yes

[09/07/2024, 13:50:24] Jude: they are very expensive. Maybe we just travel from hotel to hotel :D
[09/07/2024, 14:06:10] Andrew Wenman: how much is it?
[09/07/2024, 14:06:16] Andrew Wenman: looks very small.....
‎[09/07/2024, 14:22:47] Jude: 1.-14.1. ‎image omitted

[09/07/2024, 18:40:25] Potato Piehl  🍤: We’ll probably spend a day or two in Auckland, so it wouldn’t be full 14 days and we only need one for all of us, right?
[09/07/2024, 18:40:52] Potato Piehl  🍤: And are we actually planning on sleeping in there or would we still get hotels? That would probably make quite a difference
[09/07/2024, 18:55:23] Jude: I think we need to figure out what we want to do. At that price, I don’t think we should do both. Maybe when we plan a route - we plan where we would want to rent a motorhome. We can always split it all up a little. I feel like it might be nice for the experience, but probably not so comfortable for the whole time
[09/07/2024, 18:59:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah agree it might be a bit crammed for the whole holiday. There’s also the option to fly domestically to get around quicker
[09/07/2024, 19:01:06] Jude: Very true! Yep I think we need to plan our route etc and then we can figure all of that out
[09/07/2024, 19:01:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes probably the best approach
[09/07/2024, 19:11:25] Jude: I feel like an excel sheet might be in order!!!!

[09/07/2024, 21:11:12] Jude: Great. I think a mix of it all will be good
[09/07/2024, 21:11:26] Jude: We can do one way rentals etc
[09/07/2024, 21:18:23] Callum Smyth: Do we think we’re going to stay on the north island or go over to the South Island too?
[09/07/2024, 21:18:32] Callum Smyth: Or is it still undecided
[09/07/2024, 21:19:03] Jude: Don’t think we have talked about it 😂
[09/07/2024, 21:19:22] Jude: Think it would be nice to see both - if that works in 2 weeks?
‎[09/07/2024, 21:21:54] Callum Smyth: Looks like c.90mins flights for 70-100£ return so might be worth doing a couple of days there or something? ‎image omitted
[09/07/2024, 21:26:30] Callum Smyth: Franz Josef glacier looks super cool on the South Island which has a 3 hour loop walk to get a better view of the glacier. He also recommends the tongiriro track but that’s a bit harder and is more of day hike so not too sure what the consensus is on that!
[09/07/2024, 21:30:39] Callum Smyth: The glow worm caves look really cool too, just googling some items haha

[09/07/2024, 21:44:53] Callum Smyth: (And he saw some people cosplaying as hobbits doing it lol, but means it must be that hard)
[09/07/2024, 22:04:00] Potato Piehl  🍤: Looks really cool!

[10/07/2024, 13:51:42] Jude: Or we fly down there one way and work our way up?
[10/07/2024, 13:52:26] Jude: Should we confirm flights and then we can start working on a route?
[10/07/2024, 13:52:49] Jude: Is anyone still waiting for approval of holidays?
‎[10/07/2024, 13:53:21] Jude: ‎image omitted
[10/07/2024, 14:22:20] Potato Piehl  🍤: I still need formal approval
[10/07/2024, 14:22:37] Potato Piehl  🍤: I have exactly one day of annual leave left in 2024 😅
[10/07/2024, 14:39:20] Callum Smyth: yeah I've spoke with my manager and she's emailed me with written approval and we've agreed that we will plan me being away for that period. But I cant officially book it off until november because our HR system is wank lol. So all good my side
[10/07/2024, 14:40:15] Jude: Use it wisely
[21/07/2024, 22:52:43] Callum Smyth: Also I got a new job so this is moot. But I checked with the CEO and he said 31/12 - 13/01 is all good
[30/07/2024, 13:20:44] Jude: Hello :) have done a bit of research on flights:
[30/07/2024, 13:20:51] Jude: 31.12. – 14.1. 
Lon- Akl  Return: 
•	Swiss - £900, 2 stops 33/42h
•	Lufthansa -  £11,13 2 stops 26/31h 
•	Air New Zealand - £1,358, 1 stop 30/27h

Lon – Queenstown + Akl – Lon:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,444, 2/1 stops 43/27h
Lon – Akl + Queenstown – Lon:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,457,1 / 2 stops 30/36h

Lon – Christchurch + Akl – Lon:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,389, 2/1 stops 33/27h
•	Singapore Airlines - £1,390, 1 stops, 25/37h

Lon – Akl + Christchurch – Lon:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,389, 1 / 2 stops 30/30h
[30/07/2024, 13:23:09] Jude: Lon- Queenstown:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,485, 2 stops 34/36h

Lon – Christchurch:
•	Air New Zealand - £1,363, 2 stops 33/35h
[30/07/2024, 13:23:42] Jude: OK so this is only with reasonably good airlines (excluded Chinese airlines and Jetstar etc)
[30/07/2024, 13:23:54] Jude: looks like direct to Auckland is best
[30/07/2024, 13:24:10] Jude: and we can figure out an in between flight there, right?
[30/07/2024, 14:14:26] Potato Piehl  🍤: London Auckland / Queenstown London sounds good Route wise. I’ll have a look into it too
[30/07/2024, 14:14:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’ve hear that air New Zealand is really good btw
[30/07/2024, 14:16:25] Jude: great. I'd be happy with that, too
[31/07/2024, 15:18:01] Callum Smyth: Yeah I agree with this. Saves time from island hopping back and then forth if we just go one way
[31/07/2024, 15:23:15] Andrew Wenman: I am happy with it all, going to be a fab trip
[31/07/2024, 15:31:54] Potato Piehl  🍤: My colleague recommended me to spend more time on the South Island as the landscape is stunning and he said Auckland and queenstown are great as a base and that we can skip Christchurch
[31/07/2024, 15:35:49] Jude: I did a bit of research on the north/ South Island and think both are really great and just offer different things. North has great beaches, hot springs and cultural things
[31/07/2024, 15:36:30] Potato Piehl  🍤: And the glow worm cave!
[31/07/2024, 15:37:07] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes definitely think we should do both, so starting in aukland and leaving from queenstown probably makes sense
[31/07/2024, 15:37:27] Potato Piehl  🍤: I also heard that the ferry between the two is pretty but we might not have time for that
[31/07/2024, 15:37:51] Jude: Most flights go back to Auckland again anyway. That’s included in the 2 stops then
[31/07/2024, 15:38:41] Potato Piehl  🍤: And I was told that you can easily rent camper vans in one place and drop them off in another if we want to do get one for one leg of the trip
[31/07/2024, 15:38:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ah yes that’s good
[31/07/2024, 15:38:45] Jude: Oh yes! Also heard the transalpine train
[31/07/2024, 15:39:12] Jude: Yep that should be easy. Same goes for cars, so we can mix as we need
[31/07/2024, 15:39:28] Potato Piehl  🍤: Oh yeah that looks cool!
[31/07/2024, 15:40:24] Jude: National Geographic calls the TranzAlpine train one of the world's greatest scenic train trips.
[31/07/2024, 15:40:34] Andrew Wenman: I do love a train
[31/07/2024, 15:47:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: Especially a scenic one!
[06/08/2024, 19:21:47] Jude: Any more thoughts on the flights? :)
[06/08/2024, 19:34:56] Callum Smyth: I’ve just asked brad if he can confirm when he will be in Auckland. Then, if possible, it’d be preferable for me if we can either fly into or leave from the north island when he is there. Then leave from the island we don’t fly into
[06/08/2024, 19:35:04] Callum Smyth: If that makes sense? 🤔
[06/08/2024, 19:43:04] Jude: Yep :)
[06/08/2024, 19:44:08] Callum Smyth: do you want us to check for more flights?
[06/08/2024, 21:51:29] Callum Smyth: My friend isn’t sure when he’ll be in NZ so we can just book when we want
[06/08/2024, 22:20:51] Callum Smyth: For organising it might be useful to use trello? Its a free planning tool. I’ve made a very basic board here:
https://trello.com/invite/b/66b2919cf2ec5ccc0a6b5f41/ATTIf5ad56a259f362c17df92f94a60707ad573C2280/new-zealand
Which you should just be able to request to join.

Essentially in the left column we can add items for what we want to do (I’ve added a couple in there). Then the other columns are for the days we’re there. So we can drop the items onto the days and start building up an itinerary. We can also add items for transfers between places / activites to make sure its feasible
[06/08/2024, 22:22:08] Callum Smyth: On each item we can also add more information when you click on the ticket. So for ‘flight to other island’ we can add prices and how long it takes etc
[07/08/2024, 06:33:26] Jude: ‎This message was deleted.
[07/08/2024, 06:35:14] Jude: Any preference on where to start? It sounds like South Island is a bit more full of action, so maybe we can start there? And have a couple of more relaxing days before we get home? But I don’t really mind 😂
[07/08/2024, 08:19:03] Potato Piehl  🍤: I was told north to south is better as it gets more beautiful landscape wise and start with the city then venture out it nature makes sense in my head, but the north island is better for beaches and swimming, which could be a nice at the end
[07/08/2024, 08:27:55] Jude: Hm difficult. Well to be honest we always have to stopover again in Auckland. So we could do north to south, then fly back up and have a couple of days on a beach somewhere before flying back. That way we also split up the flight a little
[07/08/2024, 08:29:35] Jude: Also love this!!!
[07/08/2024, 08:31:55] Potato Piehl  🍤: True that could work too
‎[07/08/2024, 09:46:44] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ignore the fly in, fly out, but what do you think of a basic route like these? ‎image omitted

[07/08/2024, 09:47:49] Potato Piehl  🍤: So including one domestic flight between Auckland or rotorua and Christchurch to connect north and south
[07/08/2024, 09:49:20] Jude: We are just out and about for the day, will have a closer look this evening :)
[07/08/2024, 09:50:00] Potato Piehl  🍤: Have a fun day! 😘
[08/08/2024, 08:04:29] Jude: Ok so that sounds roughly right! I would love to do bay of islands or something, if that works time wise.
[08/08/2024, 09:48:50] Potato Piehl  🍤: That could actually be really nice towards the end I think, if we works our way north.
[08/08/2024, 10:46:58] Callum Smyth: bay of islands might be worth doing over night? looks like a fair drive from auckland but there are stops on the way
‎[08/08/2024, 10:47:05] Callum Smyth: ‎image omitted
[25/09/2024, 10:31:31] Callum Smyth: When are we looking at booking these flights?
[25/09/2024, 11:29:20] Jude: Think we need to get it sorted. But I assume these are outdated now.
[25/09/2024, 12:35:47] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’ll have another look into flights on the weekend. Also don’t worry of course in case it doesn’t work out now with the house planning going on. Imagine you’ll have quite a lot to sort out
[25/09/2024, 12:37:22] Callum Smyth: Yeah I can reprice these too on Sunday eve
[25/09/2024, 12:38:13] Callum Smyth: Congrats on the offer acceptance !
[25/09/2024, 12:38:40] Andrew Wenman: Thank you!!
[25/09/2024, 12:38:51] Andrew Wenman: how is your guys search going?
[25/09/2024, 13:00:31] Callum Smyth: Got a mortgage in principal so know our budget. We also spent a good day on Saturday in Forest Gate exploring so will be looking there
[25/09/2024, 13:01:04] Callum Smyth: We actually found a perfect property but people are already putting in offer and we haven’t viewed so missed out on that one haha
[25/09/2024, 13:01:25] Jude: Too far from Crystal Palace! 😂
[25/09/2024, 13:04:54] Andrew Wenman: Forest Hill is nice, and some of the places have great views
[25/09/2024, 13:08:04] Andrew Wenman: But more importantly is that Forest Gate also a lovely place to look for a house
[25/09/2024, 14:53:50] Potato Piehl  🍤: 😂
[30/09/2024, 10:05:52] Jude: Helloooo. So we talked over the weekend and are a bit concerned, that with the new house now, the holiday could come at a tricky time. We might be in the midst of chaos at that time. Also it’s not a cheap trip of course…. So I think it might all be a bit much this time.
I am gutted, because we had planned this forever and things keep coming up. So please do feel free to book without us
[30/09/2024, 11:12:26] Potato Piehl  🍤: Hey, this makes total sense and no worries! You’ll have lots to do with the house now, so probably the right decision to not add a big holiday plan to it 😅
[30/09/2024, 11:15:17] Jude: I know just a bit gutted because we have been trying to do this for so long.
[30/09/2024, 16:47:27] Callum Smyth: We did have a chat about this and was kind of expecting it bf haha

[25/11/2025, 20:03:35] Jude: How are those dates for you?
[25/11/2025, 20:04:01] Jude: Have been trying to find some flights to use our points so that limits our available dates
[25/11/2025, 23:32:35] Callum Smyth: Is it possible to do longer, like 14 days or so?
[26/11/2025, 06:55:16] Jude: Yep you’re right, would be better
[26/11/2025, 06:55:39] Jude: I think we will skip trying to use the points, it only has like 2 options and doesn’t really work
[26/11/2025, 06:56:10] Jude: So as Andy is going skiing, mid/ late March would be best
[26/11/2025, 06:56:20] Jude: I’ll have a look for flights/ offers today
[26/11/2025, 18:47:48] Callum Smyth: fine with me, I dont really have any plans post January currently
‎[26/11/2025, 20:02:45] Jude: ‎image omitted
[26/11/2025, 20:02:55] Jude: £700 each
[26/11/2025, 20:03:12] Jude: Would those dates work? Or would you prefer earlier?
[26/11/2025, 20:46:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: That sounds good! And 700 isn’t bad either 😀
[27/11/2025, 11:07:31] Callum Smyth: Should I sign up for jacks flight club for a week or so to see if them deals are in this deal ?
[27/11/2025, 11:07:39] Callum Smyth: I don’t think it says dates on the email
[27/11/2025, 11:08:20] Jude: Yes!
[27/11/2025, 11:11:10] Callum Smyth: I’ll do it over lunch
‎[27/11/2025, 11:16:19] Callum Smyth: ahh its not to bangkok, only chiang mai 😔 oh well, worth trying for a quid ‎image omitted
[27/11/2025, 11:23:55] Jude: I didn’t know there was direct flight to Chiangmai crazy
[27/11/2025, 12:21:01] Jude: @⁨Callum Smyth⁩ are you still going to that other party Saturday?
[27/11/2025, 12:24:06] Callum Smyth: yeah I will be doing
[27/11/2025, 12:24:55] Jude: Ok, fair enough
[27/11/2025, 12:25:09] Jude: I’ll put in the group, if anyone wants your ticket?
[27/11/2025, 12:25:11] Andrew Wenman: booooo
[27/11/2025, 12:29:29] Callum Smyth: yeah go for it!
[27/11/2025, 12:29:40] Callum Smyth: sorry, I'm sure you'll have fun though
[27/11/2025, 12:29:59] Callum Smyth: lol
[02/12/2025, 12:12:45] Callum Smyth: is it worth trying to match up the trip to 🇹🇭 with the easter holidays? it saves 2 AL allowance and is 3-6th april
[02/12/2025, 12:26:31] Jude: We usually go and see family then…
[02/12/2025, 12:32:29] Andrew Wenman: And I think im away with my Dad that weekend
[02/12/2025, 12:44:01] Jude: But if it’s better for you, you could of course always do that. We could still have a lot overlapping
[03/12/2025, 11:46:16] Jude: What do you think?
[03/12/2025, 11:48:31] Potato Piehl  🍤: Don’t have to do Easter holiday, so all good!
[03/12/2025, 12:34:43] Jude: Ok so everyone good with the dates?
[03/12/2025, 12:35:07] Jude: 14.-28.3.
[03/12/2025, 12:35:20] Jude: Or we could even go on the 13., as it’s a 9pm flight
[03/12/2025, 12:54:49] Callum Smyth: yeah 13th - 28th would be good
[03/12/2025, 12:55:11] Callum Smyth: i can put in a holiday request whenever this week, boss is off next week though
[03/12/2025, 13:07:55] Jude: Ok I can check with work today - let me know when we’re all ok to book :)
[03/12/2025, 13:07:57] Jude: So exciting
[08/12/2025, 19:03:27] Jude: How is everyone doing for the dates? Or not quite ready yet?
[08/12/2025, 19:24:09] Callum Smyth: I am good to book whenever, boss is off until friday so won’t get approval until then
[08/12/2025, 19:25:43] Jude: Ok great, me too. Andy doesn’t have to
[08/12/2025, 19:50:19] Potato Piehl  🍤: Do we think we‘ll be fine with the boarder conflict escalations at the moment?
[08/12/2025, 19:50:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: Or should we wait in case it gets worse?

[08/12/2025, 20:04:30] Jude: Yes we checked that earlier. If we get travel insurance right away, then we get our money back right, if something changes?
[08/12/2025, 20:04:40] Jude: Or maybe it’s not the time to book it…
[08/12/2025, 20:13:16] Jude: Or we’ll look at somewhere else?
[08/12/2025, 21:03:43] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah I think we’d get our money back as long as we stay out of the areas that are advised against. Not 100% sure though, so maybe worth double checking. At the moment I’d still be fine going
[08/12/2025, 21:06:24] Potato Piehl  🍤: Egypt also has a travel warning for the border regions and it doesn’t affect the area I’m in right now
[09/12/2025, 10:11:04] Callum Smyth: what parts of thailand would we want to go?
[09/12/2025, 10:11:14] Callum Smyth: if it is not within 50km of the border it should be fine
[09/12/2025, 10:11:31] Callum Smyth: For those travelling to Thailand, the British Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to border areas within 50km of the whole border with Cambodia.

While for those in Cambodia, it advises against all but essential travel to border areas within 50km of the whole border with Thailand.
[09/12/2025, 10:15:49] Jude: Not worried about that one. But on the map it also shows the boarder to Malaysia
[09/12/2025, 10:16:19] Jude: Which would be more the direction with the islands. But probably can also choose to not go too far south
[09/12/2025, 10:19:50] Callum Smyth: ahh yeah you're right just seen that
[09/12/2025, 10:20:25] Callum Smyth: funnily enough my mate brad, who lived in nz, is going to thailand after chrsitmas, and another mate lived in thailand for 3 years
[09/12/2025, 10:20:42] Callum Smyth: i can see which areas they're going / reccomend
[09/12/2025, 10:22:16] Callum Smyth: do we have a list of places we want to go?
[09/12/2025, 11:42:27] Jude: Don’t think a list, but islands in the south are def amazing. I’ve been a few times and koh lipe was one of my fav places. Koh lanta is also nice and lots of little islands in between. And maybe langkawi I thought, that’s Malaysia - but also cool. But we can adjust our route once we get to the planning
[09/12/2025, 13:38:30] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah we won’t need to book the exact places now. If we can, I’d love to see the South Island
[09/12/2025, 14:20:54] Jude: Yes I’d prefer to go south over north tbh. But anyway we will need to meet and figure out a plan then :)
[09/12/2025, 14:21:13] Jude: But sounds like we’re all still up for going, so I’ll put in the holiday request for the dates now
[09/12/2025, 14:21:19] Andrew Wenman: To the PUB!
[09/12/2025, 14:28:50] Jude: Thanks for your valuable contribution 🥳
[09/12/2025, 14:29:20] Andrew Wenman: You are most welcome
[09/12/2025, 15:14:56] Jude: ‎Jude changed the group name to “Thailand Crew”
[16/12/2025, 08:50:03] Jude: Hey ho - how is everyone doing?
[16/12/2025, 08:50:31] Jude: I have holidays approved and my mum is coming for the dogs
[16/12/2025, 10:35:37] Callum Smyth: Did we decide on 14 - 28  or 13 - 28 of march?
[16/12/2025, 10:35:48] Callum Smyth: I will get it booked today ✈️
[16/12/2025, 10:38:41] Jude: Either way, flight in the 13th would be at 9pm
[16/12/2025, 10:38:54] Jude: Need to check what flights are better now
[16/12/2025, 10:46:51] Callum Smyth: Ah makes sense
‎[16/12/2025, 10:46:53] Callum Smyth: ‎image omitted
[16/12/2025, 11:38:11] Callum Smyth: got the holidays approved
[16/12/2025, 11:53:24] Potato Piehl  🍤: Mine was approved too 😀
[16/12/2025, 12:06:17] Jude: ❤️
[16/12/2025, 12:06:21] Andrew Wenman: Mine too

[16/12/2025, 12:17:11] Andrew Wenman: I like this comparison
[16/12/2025, 17:58:54] Jude: Do we think the flights get cheaper on Boxing Day sale? Or rather book now?
‎[16/12/2025, 18:00:00] Jude: ‎image omitted
[16/12/2025, 18:50:56] Callum Smyth: yeah it looks like we should wait then?
[16/12/2025, 18:54:35] Jude: Yer I think so
[20/12/2025, 20:16:16] Jude: Check out 500 Rai Floating Resort on Booking.com! https://www.booking.com/Share-9AlXoI
[20/12/2025, 20:18:05] Jude: Check out Rock and Tree House Resort on Booking.com! https://www.booking.com/Share-VegqGz
[21/12/2025, 11:12:12] Callum Smyth: They both look sick!
[21/12/2025, 12:47:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: Wooooow!! So cool!
‎[22/12/2025, 12:09:28] Callum Smyth: Sale is on, although I can not see a before and after price. Seems relatively cheap though? ‎image omitted
[22/12/2025, 12:12:19] Jude: Is that the return price?
[22/12/2025, 12:13:50] Callum Smyth: one way
‎[22/12/2025, 12:15:33] Callum Smyth: Circa 1000 return dates are a bit out. My nieces are telling me off for being on my laptop lol ‎image omitted
[22/12/2025, 12:26:41] Jude: Hm it was £700 before
[22/12/2025, 12:31:25] Callum Smyth: Not a great sale then
[22/12/2025, 12:31:47] Jude: Hm the other option is we fly directly to Phuket.
[22/12/2025, 12:31:58] Jude: If we’re planning to do more islands/ south
[22/12/2025, 12:32:18] Callum Smyth: My mum reckons there is a ‚mega sale‘ after Christmas
[22/12/2025, 12:33:08] Jude: Yer I think it’s supposed to start properly Boxing Day
[22/12/2025, 12:33:17] Callum Smyth: Ah cool are we skipping Bangkok completely?
[22/12/2025, 12:33:30] Jude: No idea. We need to discuss
[22/12/2025, 12:33:41] Callum Smyth: I’m off work now until the new year so can have a look at prices
[22/12/2025, 12:33:48] Jude: Was just thinking maybe even one way Phuket might be good
‎[22/12/2025, 13:52:34] Callum Smyth: Found a t shirt for you @⁨Andrew Wenman⁩ ‎image omitted
‎[22/12/2025, 21:15:55] Callum Smyth: Price is for return ‎image omitted
[22/12/2025, 21:19:15] Jude: Yet that’s not bad. And if we want to do Bangkok, we can fly there one way and return from Phuket?
[22/12/2025, 21:22:26] Callum Smyth: yeah, I think we go with Qatar rather than air china, even though air china is cheaper
[22/12/2025, 21:22:40] Jude: 100%
‎[22/12/2025, 21:22:46] Jude: ‎image omitted
[22/12/2025, 21:30:06] Callum Smyth: Nice 667 is relatively cheap I guess
[22/12/2025, 21:30:56] Jude: Thinking maybe start the hols with a couple of days Bangkok, then fly south - depending on where we want to go - hat Yai/ krabi/ koh samui. And then work our way to Phuket
‎[22/12/2025, 21:46:05] Callum Smyth: could also go direct to Bangkok. But its a bit expensive. And not sure if Thai airways are as good as Qatar ‎image omitted
‎[22/12/2025, 21:51:46] Jude: ‎image omitted
[22/12/2025, 21:53:00] Jude: Maybe BA’s sale on Boxing Day will be better and we can get a direct Ba flight
[22/12/2025, 21:53:18] Callum Smyth: Yeah I did a bit of google as well. It seems like Thai are generally quite good but Qatar are the best. And Qatar is a bit cheaperr but longer
[22/12/2025, 21:53:36] Callum Smyth: Qatar maintain their planes better too, the Thai ones are a bit run down by all accounts
[22/12/2025, 21:55:44] Jude: Yep I’m happy to stick with Qatar
[22/12/2025, 21:56:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: I‘m happy with either. Quite like a direct and wouldn’t mind Thai but Qatar is probably still a bit nicer and the airport is supposed to be good too
[22/12/2025, 22:07:56] Jude: So everyone happy with the route? Or does anyone want to go north?
[22/12/2025, 22:08:39] Potato Piehl  🍤: Works for me! I’d like to go south
[24/12/2025, 11:23:20] Callum Smyth: Going for a Thai tasting menu in Bangkok would be fun
[24/12/2025, 11:23:23] Callum Smyth: https://www.taanbangkok.com/main/menu/
[24/12/2025, 11:58:01] Jude: Yes!!!
[24/12/2025, 12:27:32] Potato Piehl  🍤: Oh yeahhh
[27/12/2025, 08:37:01] Jude: BA sales are not helping us at all
[27/12/2025, 09:59:56] Jude: I think this flight is still our best option?
[27/12/2025, 10:03:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah I think that one is pretty decent. Etihad has a decent bkk option to if we wanted to start there

[27/12/2025, 10:04:28] Potato Piehl  🍤: Although the evening one isn’t an a380
[27/12/2025, 10:05:22] Jude: Is that one way? The other one was to Bangkok and return from Phuket
[27/12/2025, 10:05:49] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ah I misread
[27/12/2025, 10:05:54] Potato Piehl  🍤: That’s better then
[27/12/2025, 10:06:08] Potato Piehl  🍤: Only annoying that it’d mean another day of leave
[27/12/2025, 10:07:24] Jude: Yes that’s true
‎[27/12/2025, 10:09:39] Jude: There’s also a later one same price ‎image omitted
[27/12/2025, 10:10:21] Potato Piehl  🍤: That would be good
[27/12/2025, 10:10:32] Potato Piehl  🍤: Do you know how long the wait is for the flight back? ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/2025, 10:12:04] Potato Piehl  🍤: Are you looking on Skyscanner? I can’t find the flight for some reason

[27/12/2025, 10:36:18] Jude: But crappy having a 3h stop in the middle of the night

[27/12/2025, 10:38:15] Jude: Hm I don’t see that combination
[27/12/2025, 10:38:27] Jude: But yes if we can get that
[27/12/2025, 10:40:37] Potato Piehl  🍤: I can’t find the outbound flight on the Qatar website
[27/12/2025, 10:42:07] Jude: Probably because it’s BA
[27/12/2025, 10:42:40] Jude: Hm or not I’m confused now
[27/12/2025, 10:47:00] Potato Piehl  🍤: I found a 4pm one outgoing
[27/12/2025, 10:47:11] Potato Piehl  🍤: On the BA site but operated by Qatar

[27/12/2025, 10:50:47] Jude: 😂

[27/12/2025, 10:52:06] Jude: £570 just to Doha?
[27/12/2025, 10:52:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: I saw the etihad ones too. Maybe that’s an option
[27/12/2025, 10:52:54] Potato Piehl  🍤: And they’re a good airline too
[27/12/2025, 10:52:55] Callum Smyth: Yeah. When going to bkk it doesn’t appear so maybe it’s just not an option for connecting
[27/12/2025, 10:52:59] Callum Smyth: It’s weird
[27/12/2025, 11:01:04] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes I think etihad is a good option. And it’s available to book on the Etihad website too and not just on a dodgy third party site 😅
[27/12/2025, 11:12:09] Jude: Great
[28/12/2025, 10:40:07] Jude: Ok so did a bit more research on flights - short layovers and not though third party providers
[28/12/2025, 10:40:38] Jude: The ethihad flights come to ca £950, maybe a bit more depending on seats
[28/12/2025, 10:43:27] Jude: Oman air would come to around £890 and has very similar flights and is also very good.
[28/12/2025, 10:43:34] Jude: I don’t mind either

[28/12/2025, 20:13:50] Potato Piehl  🍤: Hey, thanks Jude! Fine with either, but slightly leaning towards Etihad because one leg should be A380, which is a bit more comfy. And the Abu Dhabi airport is supposed to be good as well
[29/12/2025, 19:18:30] Jude: God those flights are getting very expensive. Just did both with seat selection - but cheapest seats available

‎[29/12/2025, 19:18:36] Jude: ‎image omitted
[29/12/2025, 19:18:40] Jude: Almost £1000 each
[29/12/2025, 19:18:50] Jude: Ethihad more
[29/12/2025, 20:36:13] Potato Piehl  🍤: Would it make sense if we did BKK BKK rather than Phuket? I think that’s the more expensive flight, but then we’d have to make our way back up, which might not make sense/ a big price difference
[29/12/2025, 20:43:30] Jude: Yer we just looked at other flights. Think £1000 pp is too much for us
[29/12/2025, 20:44:04] Jude: BKK/ BKK would be an option, just need to take into consideration that we might need to fly back up to bkk
[29/12/2025, 20:45:14] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah and then it probably won’t make too much of a difference
[29/12/2025, 20:45:26] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’ll have another look too
[29/12/2025, 20:46:43] Jude: We looked at separate bookings. Ethihad to fly to bkk then BA/ Qatar to go back from Phuket
[29/12/2025, 20:47:35] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah that’d work too
[29/12/2025, 20:49:31] Jude: Ok - is everyone around tomorrow maybe and we can sort it?
[29/12/2025, 20:52:20] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes! Does early evening work for you? We’re returning our rental car over lunch
[29/12/2025, 20:53:11] Jude: Perfect, what time?
[29/12/2025, 20:54:06] Potato Piehl  🍤: Around 6 ish? We’re flexible
[29/12/2025, 20:55:06] Jude: Yes great. Just so we have a time and I’m not running off doing something else 😂
[29/12/2025, 21:09:13] Jude: Also where are you?
[29/12/2025, 21:11:34] Potato Piehl  🍤: Just on our way back from Cal‘s parents. Trains aren’t running until the new year, so we’re driving down
[29/12/2025, 21:54:30] Jude: Oh wow! Safe drive!

[30/12/2025, 18:52:44] Callum Smyth: what are the extras? Are there any useful ones haha
[30/12/2025, 18:53:11] Jude: No
[30/12/2025, 18:53:16] Jude: Just priority boarding
‎[30/12/2025, 18:54:06] Jude: So if we book this + seats it’s cheaper ‎image omitted
[30/12/2025, 18:54:22] Jude: The comfort vs flex
[30/12/2025, 18:54:34] Jude: But it has 20kg instead of 30kg
[30/12/2025, 18:54:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: I‘m fine with 20kg
[30/12/2025, 18:55:20] Callum Smyth: Yeah that should be enough anyway
[30/12/2025, 18:55:40] Jude: I think more than 20 will be hard to carry around

[30/12/2025, 18:56:37] Jude: Can you try?
[30/12/2025, 18:56:54] Jude: Backpack. I think suitcases will be tricky if we are going to islands

[30/12/2025, 19:39:06] Andrew Wenman: Whoop
[30/12/2025, 19:39:15] Callum Smyth: 🇹🇭
[30/12/2025, 19:39:38] Jude: Going to have to start looking at a route
[30/12/2025, 19:39:42] Jude: So exciting
[30/12/2025, 19:55:57] Jude: Here’s a menu of the best Southern Thailand places (with quick “what it feels like” descriptions) so you can pick what fits your vibe. For mid–late March, you’re generally in the dry, sunny season in the south (it’ll be hot), which is great for islands and boat days.  ￼

Andaman Coast (west side: Phuket/Krabi down to Lipe)

Krabi + Railay / Ao Nang
	•	Classic limestone cliffs + turquoise bays; Railay is only reachable by boat and is famous for dramatic scenery and climbing. Great base for island-hopping day trips.  ￼

Koh Phi Phi
	•	Iconic postcard islands (yes, “that” scenery). Very easy as a day trip from Phuket/Krabi, or 1–2 nights if you want the vibe and viewpoints.

Koh Lanta
	•	More laid-back than Phi Phi/Phuket; long beaches, easy scootering, sunsets, and a calmer “couples/friends chill” feel. Nice if you want downtime without being remote.

Koh Lipe
	•	Small island with soft sand + clear water + coral reefs; feels a bit “far away” (near Tarutao National Park). Excellent for snorkeling and beach-hopping.  ￼

Phuket
	•	Biggest “hub” (easy flights, lots of hotels/restaurants). Choose it if you want convenience, beach clubs, nightlife options, and day trips in every direction.

Khao Lak + Similan/Surin area
	•	Quieter mainland beach base north of Phuket; people use it for boat trips to famous snorkel/dive spots. Note: the Similan Islands National Park typically closes mid-May to mid-Oct (so March is usually within the open season).  ￼

Gulf of Thailand (east side: Samui/Phangan/Tao)

Koh Tao
	•	One of Thailand’s top diving/snorkeling islands; smaller, adventure-y, great boat trips (incl. Koh Nang Yuan viewpoints).  ￼

Koh Phangan
	•	Not just Full Moon—also has beautiful coves, viewpoints, yoga/wellness pockets, and relaxed beach areas (you can completely avoid the party scene if you want).

Koh Samui
	•	Easiest/most developed in the Gulf: lots of comfort, resorts, restaurants, and short hops to Phangan/Tao.

Jungle / inland “wow” stop (still South)

Khao Sok National Park + Cheow Lan Lake
	•	Rainforest + towering limestone + floating raft houses on a lake; very “nature reset” and a great contrast to beaches.  ￼

[02/01/2026, 16:27:08] Potato Piehl  🍤: Tempel dinner cruise sounds quite fun
[02/01/2026, 16:27:17] Andrew Wenman: I agree
[02/01/2026, 16:27:19] Andrew Wenman: Up for that
[02/01/2026, 16:30:15] Jude: Andy and I are inspired. Going to order Thai tonight
[02/01/2026, 16:30:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ohh good shout!

We got this Bangkok hotel on sale on Secret Escapaes at the moment. It looks really cool, but I think it’s a bit out of the centre. Not really sure we’re is good to stay though
[03/01/2026, 16:41:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: https://www.secretescapes.com/trendy-bangkok-hotel-with-fabulous-city-views-mode-sathorn-hotel-thailand/sale-hotel 

This one looks quite cool too, is more central I think and quite a bit cheaper
[03/01/2026, 16:42:15] Potato Piehl  🍤: We’d get 20% off on any secret escapes deals too
‎[03/01/2026, 20:16:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: Thai for us too tonight 😄 ‎image omitted
[16/01/2026, 19:17:47] Jude: Helloooo! Ok so thinking we need to get our route sorted
[16/01/2026, 19:18:08] Jude: Please add any places you think might be good to the list and then we can have a vote
[16/01/2026, 19:31:38] Jude: Need to decide if we want to do both coasts - which would be nice, but also adds some serious travel
[16/01/2026, 19:32:34] Jude: The core issue: Andaman + Gulf in one trip

👍 Pros
	•	You get maximum variety
	•	Andaman = dramatic limestone cliffs, turquoise water, remote islands
	•	Gulf = calmer seas, softer beaches, great snorkelling (Tao), chilled nightlife (Phangan)
	•	March is technically fine for both sides

👎 Cons (this is the real cost)
	•	One long, annoying travel day (Lanta → Phangan/Tao = bus + ferry)
	•	You lose ~1 full holiday day to logistics
	•	Mentally it feels like two separate trips stitched together
	•	You’ll already have had amazing snorkelling on Lipe + Trang islands — Tao becomes less “wow”, more “nice but similar”

👉 For most people, that trade-off doesn’t feel great unless they really want Tao diving or Phangan specifically.
[16/01/2026, 20:14:07] Callum Smyth: we looked at a route which is flying down south then working up:

Day 1 – Bangkok → Hat Yai
Fly Bangkok ✈️ Hat Yai (~1.5 hrs)
Overnight in Hat Yai to rest before island hopping

Day 2 – Hat Yai → Ko Tarutao
Minivan: Hat Yai → Pak Bara Pier (~2 hrs)
Speedboat → Ko Tarutao (~45–60 min)

Why Tarutao: first taste of Thailand’s wild side — empty beaches, jungle, wildlife

Afternoon: beach walk, swim
Evening: quiet night in basic bungalows

Day 3 – Ko Tarutao
Full day in national park
Cycle jungle trails, see prison ruins & waterfalls
Relax on deserted beaches, enjoy peace & nature
Early night under the stars

Day 4 – Ko Tarutao → Koh Lipe
Morning speedboat (~1 hr)
Why Lipe: tropical paradise, classic Thailand vibes, good mix of comfort and adventure

Check in near Sunrise Beach
Snorkel right from the beach, sunset drinks, explore Walking Street

Day 5 – Koh Lipe

Beach hopping: Sunrise Beach, Pattaya Beach
Optional scuba diving (2-tank dive spots) or snorkelling
Evening: local restaurants & bars

Day 6 – Koh Lipe → Koh Lanta
Speedboat (~4–5 hrs, scenic via Koh Ngai/Kradan)
Why Lanta: big, relaxed island; perfect for group chill time
Afternoon: relax on the beach, dinner by the sea

Day 7 – Koh Lanta
Long sandy beaches, sunsets at Kantiang Bay
Swim, relax, beach bars
Optional evening scooter ride along coast

Day 8 – Koh Lanta

Day 9 – Koh Lanta → Krabi → Bangkok
Ferry/speedboat to Krabi (~2 hrs)

Day 10 – Bangkok
Markets, temples, massages
Fly home

Why this route works:

Tarutao: raw jungle & nature experience
Lipe: tropical paradise, snorkeling/scuba, restaurants
Lanta: comfortable chill island, great beaches, optional scuba, group-friendly

Minimal long boat days, smooth flow, easy flights in/out ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2026, 20:24:19] Potato Piehl  🍤: Or the other way round
[16/01/2026, 20:25:37] Potato Piehl  🍤: Not sure if tarutao is too far off the beaten track and it looks very basic
[16/01/2026, 20:26:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: Id quite to do koh Lanta, there’s supposed to be some good diving too there. Apparently we’re in season for andaman sea diving
[16/01/2026, 20:29:16] Potato Piehl  🍤: Jude have you been to Phi Phi? It looks super cool with those rocks
[16/01/2026, 20:32:27] Potato Piehl  🍤: If we do one side only, I’d be more keen on the Andaman side. Question is if we want gulf for koh Tao diving

[16/01/2026, 20:36:33] Jude: Same. I think there’s good diving on the andaman coast, too.
[16/01/2026, 20:37:05] Jude: Yes, I think koh lanta is a good spot for us.
[16/01/2026, 20:37:32] Jude: I have. It’s beautiful but also super touristy. But we could do a day trip from koh lanta rather than stay
[16/01/2026, 20:39:27] Jude: Hadn’t heard of it, but it looks great! I also looked at the hat hai flights south and then going up, that could be a good way. And we could do a short stop on a tiny island on the way up too (koh bulong or something)
[16/01/2026, 20:40:26] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yesh that way we can add koh lipe as well
[16/01/2026, 20:40:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah tiny island could be cool for a night
[16/01/2026, 20:40:50] Jude: I wouldn’t stay much on phi phi. I think going there from lanta would be good. If we have a few days on lanta, we can also go to krabi / railway from there
[16/01/2026, 20:40:58] Potato Piehl  🍤: Oh yes, it’s only a short ride away
[16/01/2026, 20:41:17] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah that sounds good

[16/01/2026, 20:49:22] Jude: Apparently koh libong is the best place to see them (also on the way up from lipe)
[16/01/2026, 20:49:27] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ohhhhh I want to swim with those!!?
[16/01/2026, 20:49:46] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes!!

[16/01/2026, 20:50:19] Jude: I really want to see those now!!! Never heard of them before
[16/01/2026, 20:50:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’ve seen manatees before and they are the cutest things
[16/01/2026, 20:51:44] Jude: So cool
[16/01/2026, 20:54:27] Jude: Apparently you can’t swim with them. See them by boat only
[16/01/2026, 20:55:19] Potato Piehl  🍤: That’s sad, but understandable. There’s probably not that many of them
‎[16/01/2026, 20:55:50] Jude: ‎image omitted
[16/01/2026, 21:04:40] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah can add that in. Looks like a nice place too and not busy
[16/01/2026, 21:12:41] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ngai looks lush as well
[16/01/2026, 21:15:30] Jude: I think I’ve either been to bulong or ngai. I can’t remember 😂
‎[16/01/2026, 21:16:01] Jude: ‎image omitted
[16/01/2026, 22:16:33] Potato Piehl  🍤: What are your thoughts on ngai vs bulon? Just had a bit of a google and Bulon has maybe a bit more of this tiny remote island vibe that we wanted
[16/01/2026, 22:20:31] Jude: True. But ngai has snorkelling just off the beach. Bulon the sea can be a bit rougher
[16/01/2026, 23:01:00] Potato Piehl  🍤: This looks really cool too, but probably a bit out the way https://www.instagram.com/reel/DThXiaCCBvu/?igsh=ZzVqdWVianBuNWc0
[17/01/2026, 07:25:30] Jude: Yes I saw that one too. But it’s quite the travel….
[18/01/2026, 09:12:42] Jude:
‎[18/01/2026, 09:12:43] Jude: Once we include luggage this should be about £70 each and includes the flight, van and ferry to koh lipe ‎image omitted

[18/01/2026, 11:49:27] Potato Piehl  🍤: Nice! I like the all connections guaranteed bit 😀
[18/01/2026, 14:00:51] Jude: Yes I read it’s better to book something all in one, rather than all 3 things separately
[20/01/2026, 09:31:51] Jude: Let me know, if everyone is happy with this - then I will book :) I feel like that part of the route is confirmed, I assume? Or do we need to make changes?
[20/01/2026, 09:51:01] Callum Smyth: Are we doing Bangkok at the end then? Just thinking we’re only going to really have time to have a quick sleep before leaving back to the airport
[20/01/2026, 10:24:09] Jude: No we will have 1 full day then
[20/01/2026, 10:24:20] Jude: And then have another day at the end
[20/01/2026, 10:39:27] Callum Smyth: Yep you’re right
[20/01/2026, 14:46:45] Jude: ‎Jude changed the group description
[20/01/2026, 14:38:08] Potato Piehl  🍤: Happy!
[20/01/2026, 14:38:11] Potato Piehl  🍤: Sorry didn’t see this
[20/01/2026, 14:45:10] Jude: No worries at all :) I will book this. Also will set up a Google folder for us to add everything into
[20/01/2026, 14:46:47] Jude: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PsFrU2Q8i8u9CmhY4CThvdlRqozdj7ra?usp=sharing
[20/01/2026, 19:35:42] Jude: right, just looking at this and wanted to confirm, before I book anything. All happy, if I book the connection to Koh Lipe on the 16th March? (so having 1 full day in Bangkok before)?
[20/01/2026, 19:36:19] Jude: This was the latest plan - can obvs still make changes - just looking at the beginning for now
[20/01/2026, 19:58:31] Callum Smyth: All good!
[20/01/2026, 20:05:25] Jude: going to need passport details for the booking actually
[20/01/2026, 20:05:44] Jude: no rush, but send over when you can :) will book then

[24/01/2026, 16:42:15] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’ll have a look at koh Lanta. I think there’s some good diving trips from there and a lot of other things to do as well
[24/01/2026, 17:34:45] Jude: Agreed. I think koh lanta is going to be a really good spot
[25/01/2026, 08:17:15] Jude: Are there any hotels in Bangkok from secret escapes?

[25/01/2026, 12:36:00] Potato Piehl  🍤: I think most deals have a minimum stay of 2 nights, so can maybe use it for the end of the stay. At the start we only have one night in Bangkok, right?

[25/01/2026, 13:02:11] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes that’s what I heard too
[25/01/2026, 13:03:08] Potato Piehl  🍤: Weirdly I have 0 memory of orientation left from Bangkok. All I remember is a market, a temple, and Khao San road 😂
[25/01/2026, 13:39:30] Jude: Similar. But Chat gpt said that
[25/01/2026, 13:48:54] Jude: I can’t see prices for these, but they look nice! Think a rooftop pool would be fun
‎[25/01/2026, 14:02:45] Jude: ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 19:51:48] Jude: How much discount would we get? This does look cool and area is supposed to be good
‎[25/01/2026, 19:54:18] Jude: This seems cheaper on booking ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 20:33:17] Jude: Check out my wishlist: Ko Lipe https://booking.com/mywishlist.html?wl=2b337ea8f6864914bba9ad6b5a166282&aid=898224

‎[25/01/2026, 20:50:54] Jude: ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 21:39:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: The first one actually looks nice and it’s super cheap. I like the beach hut idea
[25/01/2026, 21:40:31] Potato Piehl  🍤: I get around 20% usually and I have 100£ in credit to spend on top. So for this one it’d be about £200
‎[25/01/2026, 21:41:10] Potato Piehl  🍤: ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 21:44:30] Jude: So without the credit it would be more expensive than booking.com? Sure you want to use your credit for this?
[25/01/2026, 21:47:25] Jude: It does - but I think we’d have to take more expensive rooms (air con and maybe beachfront?) 😂
[25/01/2026, 21:49:37] Potato Piehl  🍤: True
[25/01/2026, 21:52:29] Andrew Wenman: So are people happy with this plan, or do we want to make some changes before we start booking all the hotels?
[25/01/2026, 21:52:48] Andrew Wenman: Do we want to meet to discuss things??
[25/01/2026, 21:54:07] Potato Piehl  🍤: Happy to use the credit! Or we could save it for a better offer as the booking offer isn’t bad. The SE offer is a bit different with breakfast and drink included, but I don’t know if we need that or if it’s more fun going out for food anyway
[25/01/2026, 21:55:16] Potato Piehl  🍤: Was also wondering whether old town is good to stay in Bangkok? Could maybe do one of the stays there and one in sukhumvit. I think they might be quite different
[25/01/2026, 22:12:25] Jude: ‎Jude pinned a message
[25/01/2026, 21:58:17] Potato Piehl  🍤: Im happy, but can meet! Could maybe take a few days before we start booking to check out the destinations and make sure we want to stay there. We’re back home now, so have a bit more time to look stuff
[25/01/2026, 21:58:37] Jude: Yes I think staying in a different place on the way back would be good
[25/01/2026, 22:00:34] Jude: Ah he’s didn’t realise it has other things included and also different rooms
[25/01/2026, 22:03:17] Potato Piehl  🍤: There’s nothing in the old town  on SE and outside of Bangkok it only had main islands like Samui and Phuket, so if we want to make use of it, the sukhumvit  one might make sense
[25/01/2026, 22:04:01] Jude: It does look nice. I’d be happy with that. And then we can do old town at the end of the
[25/01/2026, 22:04:16] Jude: And a pool to start with will be fun
‎[25/01/2026, 22:04:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: This one doenst look bad either, and it’s closer to the old town. But not sure about this specific area ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 22:05:04] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah I agree

[25/01/2026, 22:09:46] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah the sukhumvit one does sound more fun!
[25/01/2026, 22:11:18] Jude: Ok great, let’s work our way through it then step by step and if there is anything else, we can obvs change it. And I don’t think we have to book day trips / diving necessarily, just added these as notes
[25/01/2026, 22:13:50] Jude: I’m so excited!!!
[25/01/2026, 22:16:39] Potato Piehl  🍤: Me tooo!!!
‎[25/01/2026, 22:20:04] Potato Piehl  🍤: This sounds cool in koh lanta ‎image omitted
‎[25/01/2026, 22:20:37] Potato Piehl  🍤: And diving/snorkelling sounds great too! ‎image omitted
[26/01/2026, 07:43:33] Jude: Yay!
[26/01/2026, 07:43:50] Jude: Should we book that one then for the first 2 nights?
[26/01/2026, 11:50:15] Potato Piehl  🍤: Let‘s wait for what my colleague is saying about the innside by melia. If it comes back on site, it might be a slightly nicer option still. If it won’t come back I’ll  book the Salil! Check in 14th, check out 16th, correct?
[26/01/2026, 11:57:31] Jude: Whoop! Yes
[26/01/2026, 13:50:17] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ok the melia won’t come back for a while, but the VIE will go live soon. It looks cool too, but I think the area for the Salil ist still better, so if everyone is happy, I can book it
[26/01/2026, 13:50:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: https://www.booking.com/Share-R08k5J this is the vie
‎[26/01/2026, 14:38:39] Jude: ‎image omitted
[26/01/2026, 14:38:57] Jude: I thinn salil still sounds better
‎[26/01/2026, 20:20:53] Jude: Beachfront bungalow ‎image omitted
[26/01/2026, 20:21:43] Jude: Not great reviews though 😂
[26/01/2026, 20:23:02] Jude: I think if we want beachfront, we’ll have to spend about £100 per night per room. But I think it would be nice….
[26/01/2026, 20:23:23] Andrew Wenman: I am very up for that
[26/01/2026, 20:23:28] Andrew Wenman: Breakfast swim

[26/01/2026, 20:38:44] Potato Piehl  🍤:
‎[26/01/2026, 20:38:45] Potato Piehl  🍤: I think the Lipe beach resort looks good ‎image omitted

[26/01/2026, 20:49:58] Jude: It does, but it also get up to almost £500 with the beachfront ones

[26/01/2026, 21:02:57] Jude: Ok Andy voted for this
[26/01/2026, 21:22:06] Potato Piehl  🍤: Me too. I like the bungalow style
[26/01/2026, 21:22:42] Callum Smyth: Yeah it looks cool
[26/01/2026, 21:23:04] Callum Smyth: This one
[26/01/2026, 21:24:52] Jude: Whoop. Ok decision made. Should I book?
[26/01/2026, 21:24:57] Jude: Which one do you want?
[26/01/2026, 21:27:26] Jude: Which type of bungalow I mean
[26/01/2026, 21:31:29] Callum Smyth: What’s the difference in the beachfront wooden bungalow and beachfront deluxe plus?
[26/01/2026, 21:31:38] Callum Smyth: i can’t really tell haha
[26/01/2026, 21:32:18] Potato Piehl  🍤: The wooden bungalow has a bigger terrace I think
[26/01/2026, 21:38:25] Potato Piehl  🍤: I’d do either one of those two
[26/01/2026, 21:39:01] Jude: Yep wooden one has a hammock. Only one of those left. I’m happy to have the other one
[26/01/2026, 21:39:14] Jude: Unless @⁨Andrew Wenman⁩ is desperate for a hammock?
[26/01/2026, 21:39:36] Andrew Wenman: Nope dont need a hammock
[26/01/2026, 21:43:51] Potato Piehl  🍤: Ok cool. Happy to share the hammock 😀
[26/01/2026, 21:46:51] Potato Piehl  🍤: Should I book the Bangkok one?
[26/01/2026, 21:47:36] Potato Piehl  🍤: @⁨Andrew Wenman⁩ were you happy with this one?
[26/01/2026, 21:51:04] Andrew Wenman: Yep very
[26/01/2026, 22:04:52] Potato Piehl  🍤: That’s all booked now
[26/01/2026, 22:06:46] Potato Piehl  🍤: And for this should we each book our own? Or would it be better booking together? I think we have the same pricing on booking
[27/01/2026, 07:12:12] Jude: Whooop thank you! Want to add it to splitwise?
[27/01/2026, 07:12:27] Jude: Yep might make sense then :) let’s do it
[27/01/2026, 08:41:06] Potato Piehl  🍤: 16th check in to 19th check out?
[27/01/2026, 09:01:01] Jude: Correct
[27/01/2026, 09:23:12] Potato Piehl  🍤: Cool, I’ve booked :)
[27/01/2026, 10:14:55] Jude: Whoop same!
[27/01/2026, 10:32:39] Jude: Ok I realised the next step to kradan doesn’t quite make sense
‎[27/01/2026, 10:33:00] Jude: As for kradan we would go past libong ‎image omitted
[27/01/2026, 10:33:45] Jude: So either we do libong first - or we swap kradan for bulong - which is ok the way
‎[27/01/2026, 10:34:14] Jude: ‎image omitted
[27/01/2026, 10:37:58] Jude: 🏝️ Key Vibes of Each Island
🌿 Koh Bulon

Very small, super quiet and tranquil — one of the most peaceful islands here.

Great if your priority is relaxation and minimal tourist crowds.

Limited facilities — bring cash and essentials with you.

Best for: Quiet beach time, hammock vibes, chilled evenings.

🐢 Koh Mook (Muk)

Home to the famous Emerald Cave, a fun short adventure swim/boat experience (weather dependent).

A bit larger with boat tour options and local life.

Best for: Snorkelling, Emerald Cave, slightly more “active” island vibe.

🏖️ Koh Kradan

Famous for one of Thailand’s best beaches — soft white sand and turquoise water.

Very pretty and laid-back — not as many amenities as Ngai or Muk but stunning beach scenery.

Best for: Gorgeous beach and swim-focused stop.

🌊 Koh Ngai

Beautiful island within the Mu Ko Lanta National Park area.

Easy to hop to Koh Muk and Koh Kradan from here by longtail boat.

Best for: Classic beach holiday vibe — swim, snorkel, chill.

[27/01/2026, 18:13:57] Potato Piehl  🍤: I need to look into it, but kradan before belong. Need to check out the other two
[27/01/2026, 18:14:16] Potato Piehl  🍤: Bulong
[27/01/2026, 18:14:52] Jude: Yep all good for everyone to do a bit of research :)
[27/01/2026, 18:15:45] Jude: We can either do 2 1 day stays or 1 - 2 day stay.
[27/01/2026, 18:16:59] Callum Smyth: Can have a look this eve too
[27/01/2026, 19:41:44] Callum Smyth: koh mook and koh kradan are only 15-20mins on the water taxi so could do both of them?
[27/01/2026, 20:15:49] Andrew Wenman: I like the look of all of them, starting to get really excited now
[27/01/2026, 21:46:05] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes I think koh mook and kradan would be cool. Magi sounds great too, but more like a resort location whereas mook and kradan sound a bit more authentic. The emerald cave sounds cool
[27/01/2026, 21:49:34] Jude: We could do 2 nights on kradan and could do koh muk and the caves from there?
[27/01/2026, 21:51:48] Callum Smyth: yeah that’d be cool
[27/01/2026, 22:05:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes agree!

[27/01/2026, 23:00:07] Potato Piehl  🍤: Looks lovely!
[27/01/2026, 23:00:47] Potato Piehl  🍤: Im so looking forward to this island life!!!
[28/01/2026, 16:34:41] Andrew Wenman: Just having a look at Koh Lanta, as we are there for a few days would people prefer to have access to a pool as well or are we not that fussed?
[28/01/2026, 17:15:11] Andrew Wenman: Also has anyone been to Koh Lanta before?
[28/01/2026, 17:18:45] Jude: I think I have been, but I’m not sure I can remember much
[28/01/2026, 17:18:47] Andrew Wenman: Ahh well we should talk
[28/01/2026, 17:19:15] Jude: The islands all blurred into one
[28/01/2026, 19:06:50] Callum Smyth: Yeah pool would be good
[28/01/2026, 19:09:53] Potato Piehl  🍤: I‘m easy
[28/01/2026, 19:49:56] Jude: Don’t mind, we’ll probably be near the sea right
[28/01/2026, 20:43:05] Callum Smyth: I’m not _too_ fussed if no one else is bothered about a pool 😹
[28/01/2026, 20:54:38] Jude: Ok well let’s see what’s there and decide from there
[28/01/2026, 20:55:18] Jude: Is everyone happy with this? There aren’t that many options on libong
‎[28/01/2026, 20:56:08] Jude: There are 2 sea view rooms left ‎image omitted
[28/01/2026, 20:59:01] Andrew Wenman: I would quite like a pool
[28/01/2026, 21:00:25] Jude: In koh lanta or in general?
[28/01/2026, 21:03:14] Andrew Wenman: Koh Lanta
[28/01/2026, 21:03:33] Andrew Wenman: If it works out
[28/01/2026, 21:03:37] Andrew Wenman: Not a deal breaker
[28/01/2026, 21:55:00] Callum Smyth: Seconded
[29/01/2026, 19:36:44] Jude: Any thoughts on this?
[29/01/2026, 19:37:31] Andrew Wenman: Happy with this
[29/01/2026, 21:06:22] Callum Smyth: Yeah looks sick
[30/01/2026, 17:55:09] Jude: Ok @⁨Potato Piehl  🍤⁩ ?
[30/01/2026, 17:55:29] Jude: Happy for you to have a look at others of course, but there isn’t that much in libong
[30/01/2026, 17:57:22] Potato Piehl  🍤: Oh sorry, thought I already looke at this
[30/01/2026, 17:58:14] Potato Piehl  🍤: Very happy with it!!
[30/01/2026, 17:58:27] Jude: Maybe you have. Might have missed it. But I just wanted to make sure everyone is happy :)
[30/01/2026, 17:58:32] Jude: Ok will book that now
[30/01/2026, 17:58:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: Thank you
‎[30/01/2026, 18:03:09] Jude: Booked! ‎image omitted
[30/01/2026, 18:05:03] Jude: And there’s only 1 boat a day - should I just book that too?

‎[30/01/2026, 18:09:39] Jude: Looks like from libong to kradan we can get our own long tail boat ‎image omitted
[30/01/2026, 18:31:47] Potato Piehl  🍤: Im amazed by this!
[30/01/2026, 18:31:51] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yes :)
[30/01/2026, 18:57:44] Potato Piehl  🍤: To the longtail boat I mean. That seems like the better option, right? Cheaper and shorter journey
[30/01/2026, 19:02:11] Potato Piehl  🍤: Sorry misunderstood
[30/01/2026, 19:02:13] Callum Smyth: Long tail would be cool. Is that 53pp or per 4
[30/01/2026, 19:02:18] Potato Piehl  🍤: That’s the whole transfer
[30/01/2026, 19:02:23] Callum Smyth: But I vote long tail
[30/01/2026, 19:02:29] Potato Piehl  🍤: We get both
[30/01/2026, 19:02:31] Callum Smyth: 🚤
[30/01/2026, 20:04:20] Jude: Yep so to libong it’s just the speedboat, but then long tail to kradan :)
[30/01/2026, 20:11:08] Jude: For the long tail boar to kradan - what time do we want this?
[30/01/2026, 20:11:33] Jude: We have to check out by 11
[30/01/2026, 20:11:42] Jude: So maybe 11.30?
[30/01/2026, 20:12:42] Callum Smyth: How long is it to get there? If it’s 11 checkout 1130 seems sensible
[30/01/2026, 20:13:45] Jude: 1h
[30/01/2026, 20:14:06] Jude: So will be before we can check in anywhere probably but oh well. We’ll just go to the beach
[30/01/2026, 20:27:24] Jude: Ok so I think it actually picks us up on the beach in front of our hotel. This is so cool
[30/01/2026, 20:27:52] Jude: So things left to boom now are the nights on kradan, lanta and the last night in Bangkok
[30/01/2026, 20:28:38] Jude: Oh and the flight back to Bangkok
[30/01/2026, 20:32:11] Potato Piehl  🍤: Nice! I can’t believe how organised everything is with this tool 😀

[30/01/2026, 20:48:14] Potato Piehl  🍤: First one looks nice, I think. The second one doesn’t look like much but had really high reviews
[30/01/2026, 20:48:35] Jude: There’s only 4 options on the island 😂
[30/01/2026, 20:48:48] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah the rest is on koh mook
[30/01/2026, 20:48:52] Jude: Yer I like this one too
[30/01/2026, 20:51:30] Jude: Yer looks nice - but no air con at all. Think I will struggle.
[30/01/2026, 20:52:16] Jude: It doesn’t really cool down at night
[30/01/2026, 20:53:28] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah maybe a bit too basic
[30/01/2026, 20:57:00] Jude: Apparently the breakfast is crap. But I guess we can go out
[30/01/2026, 20:57:24] Potato Piehl  🍤: This one looks nice too
[30/01/2026, 20:57:36] Potato Piehl  🍤: But its double the price which I don’t know is justified
[30/01/2026, 20:58:52] Jude: Yer I feel like £800 is a lot of 2 nights (even between 4 of us). It has a tv and all, but it’s not like we will be in there that much
[30/01/2026, 20:59:23] Jude: My vote would be the first one, but get the beach front. In the reviews it also says the ones at the front are new
[30/01/2026, 21:01:04] Jude: But I’m easy of course with the group decision :)
[30/01/2026, 21:09:58] Potato Piehl  🍤: First one is my favourite too
[31/01/2026, 19:11:24] Callum Smyth: First one :)
[01/02/2026, 09:42:29] Jude: Ok should we book that? I can book both rooms?

[01/02/2026, 15:07:30] Andrew Wenman: I think this one is the best position and value
[01/02/2026, 15:09:15] Jude: I love this
[01/02/2026, 15:11:02] Andrew Wenman: it is about 1.5miles from the long beach area
[01/02/2026, 15:13:37] Jude: Manageable. Also there are a couple of restaurants / bars at the beach there, so we could stay for lunches etc
[01/02/2026, 17:01:29] Potato Piehl  🍤: Private Villa would be cool, but the hotel looks lovely and is maybe a bit better located
[01/02/2026, 17:01:39] Potato Piehl  🍤: This is booked :)
[01/02/2026, 17:02:05] Jude: Yay thank you!
[01/02/2026, 17:03:30] Jude: Agreed. Also, we won’t need a kitchen, as I don’t think we will cook. And the hotel is really just bungalows again, so not like it’s in a big building
[01/02/2026, 18:18:08] Jude: Don forget to add it to splitwise
[01/02/2026, 18:30:55] Potato Piehl  🍤: Done!

[02/02/2026, 10:37:03] Callum Smyth: 10:45
[02/02/2026, 10:37:17] Potato Piehl  🍤: Sounds good
[02/02/2026, 10:37:46] Potato Piehl  🍤: I think there’s lots to do in lanta so getting there early makes sense
[02/02/2026, 10:43:49] Jude: 10.45 booked
[02/02/2026, 10:46:28] Jude: And almost the last thing - back to Bangkok

[02/02/2026, 11:09:57] Potato Piehl  🍤: I‘d go for the shorter option I think. 7 hours sounds long 😅
[02/02/2026, 11:11:00] Jude: Yer well it’s just the transfer in between
[02/02/2026, 11:11:02] Andrew Wenman: agreed
[02/02/2026, 11:15:16] Jude: Yer only thing is that one is with viet jet air
‎[02/02/2026, 11:15:24] Jude: ‎image omitted
[02/02/2026, 11:15:40] Jude: The other one is air Asia - which is better
‎[02/02/2026, 11:16:00] Jude: ‎image omitted
[02/02/2026, 11:17:41] Jude: Actually we could book the transfer separately - so we don’t have to leave until 11 with the air Asia option
[02/02/2026, 11:19:24] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah happy to do that
[11/02/2026, 12:02:48] Jude: Ok so completely forgot about this. But will get this sorted now
[11/02/2026, 12:02:58] Jude: So there are lots of different times for flights
[11/02/2026, 12:03:08] Jude: What time do we want to be in Bangkok on the 27th?
[11/02/2026, 12:03:43] Jude: I guess 5.15 is good if we just want the evening (we will have the day next day as well). But could go earlier if we wanted to?
[12/02/2026, 08:45:01] Potato Piehl  🍤: Yeah I think that’d be fine!
[13/02/2026, 08:15:39] Jude: All booked! Now we just need our last night in Bangkok
